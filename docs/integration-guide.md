## Welcome!

We're thrilled to have you here!

In this Integration Guide you'll find all the necessary information and code examples for developing MobileCoin functionality in your custom wallet app.

If you're new to MobileCoin, we recommend reading through the rest of the content in the Dev Portal. You'll find a shorter overview in [MobileCoin overview](mobilecoin.md), as well as a [Glossary](glossary.md) with the most important terms and definitions, and a regularly updated [FAQ](faq.md).

If you're already familiar with MobileCoin, but new to developing with the MobileCoin SDK, head to the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) chapter.

For quick reference of functionality, see [Developing the code](dev-overview/).

*Happy developing!*
