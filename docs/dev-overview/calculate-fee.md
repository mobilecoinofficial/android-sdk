# Calculate fee

### User experience

In order for users to send transactions, users must pay the **transaction fee**:

### Implementation

As an Android developer, you will need the following code enable the user to be charged a transaction fee:

```java
Amount amountToSend = Amount.ofMOB(valueToSend);
try {
    Amount minimalFee = mobileCoinClient.calculateMinimalFee(amountToSend);
} catch (FragmentedAccountException ex) {
    // notify user of an increased fee
    mobileCoinClient.defragmentAccount(txAmount, defragmentationDelegate);
} catch (...) {}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The code provided by the MobileCoin Wallet SDK enables the users to select a transaction fee based on the number of seconds they are willing to wait for their transaction to be sent.
{% endhint %}
