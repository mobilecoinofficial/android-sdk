# About the MobileCoin SDK Documentation Guide (for Android)

MobileCoin has developed a Software Developer Kit (**SDK**) for companies or independent developers
who want to develop a mobile wallet app. This mobile wallet app will enable users to _send_ and
_receive_ MobileCoins ([**MOB**](glossary.md)) via their mobile devices. The MobileCoin SDK
Architecture provides a layer of business logic and cryptographic operations to enable companies and
developers to get started quickly in developing their wallet app.

For more information about the MobileCoin Network, check out the
[MobileCoin Developer Portal](https://developers.mobilecoin.com/).

This manual provides a comprehensive overview of the MobileCoin SDK Architecture, and how to utilize
the MobileCoin SDK when developing a mobile wallet app, including how the **account key** operates,
and how to send and receive transactions.
