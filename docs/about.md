# About the MobileCoin SDK Documentation Guide (for Android)

MobileCoin has developed a Software Developer Kit (**SDK**) for companies or independent developers who want to develop a mobile wallet app on a messaging service. This mobile wallet app will enable cryptocurrency users to _send_ and _receive_ mobilecoins ([**MOB**](glossary.md)) via their mobile devices. The MobileCoin SDK Architecture provides a layer of business logic and cryptographic operations to enable companies and developers to get started quickly in developing their wallet app.

For more information about the MobileCoin Network, check out the \[MobileCoin Ecosystem]\(link here?) -- a brief document about the MobileCoin open-source software network.

This manual provides a comprehensive overview of the MobileCoin SDK Architecture, and how to utilize the MobileCoin SDK when developing a mobile wallet app, including how the **account key** operates, and how to send and receive transactions.
